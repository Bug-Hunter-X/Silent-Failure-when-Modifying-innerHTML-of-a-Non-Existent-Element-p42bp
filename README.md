# Silent Failure with innerHTML on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element results in a silent failure.  The code runs without throwing an error, but the intended modification doesn't occur.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code. The `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version that handles potential errors gracefully.

This type of error is difficult to debug because it doesn't produce an obvious error message.  Thorough testing and using a browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM is crucial for identifying and solving this kind of issue.
